        <h2>Finance</h2>
        <p align="center">
            Finance is defined as the management of money and includes activities like investing, borrowing, lending, budgeting, saving, and forecasting. <br>

It is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time which means it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today, based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes.

        <h2>Investments and Capital Growth</h2>
    </center>
        <p align="justify">
            Investments are necessary to grow your capital and funds. One can invest in various sources. The ideal ones are:
            <ul>
                <li>Share Markets: Share Markets are a nice place to grow your money. All you need is some little understanding on how things work. In brief, if a company has made a profitable decision/announcement, it's shares are bound to go up as all traders try to squeeze some profits out of it. But if a company is going bankrupt, no one will be willing to keep those shares and try selling it at the best available price (current market price).
                    <br>Same logic applies to the commodity markets. If a good goes high in demand, let's say gold during diwali, the prices rocket up and make an uptrend, but if there's a mass production of any crop, say cotton, the prices make a free fall or a down trend.
                    If you're an amateur in share markets it's recommended that you go for long/delivery or long-term positions rather than short-selling or intraday or any short-term positions. Select companies that you feel might make huge profits in the coming years and invest in them. Also Share markets are subject to risks and sometimes high risks, so you need to be very careful, but If you have a high risk appetite you can make huge profits.</li>
    
                <li>Real Estate: With increasing population, there is a high inflation in this sector. You can consider this option for it has low risks but needs a long time to grow your capital. You can buy a piece of land at cheap rates and sell it after a long time when the rates are high and make profits. So, if you have a lot of time and patience, this is an ideal option for you.</li>
                <li>Invest in Gold: Gold is something that is known to have its own value. Gold has always been valued ever since the ancient times. It is a safer option and also gives huge returns in relatively less time. You can buy gold when it's cheap and sell it when it reaches a suitable price. But, since gold is traded in the commodities sector it is also subject to market risks.</li>
                <li>Invest in Foreign Currencies: Many countries are now developing at a very fast rate which has resulted in inflation in their economies. This inflation can be considered as an option to grow your capital. You can trade your currency with any foreign currency at its low and then sell it when the prices increase. This is also a part of the Share Markets (FOREX) and hence, too is subject to market risks.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Debt</h2></center>
        <p align="justify">
            Debt is an amount of money borrowed by one party from another. A debt agreement allows borrowing party to borrow money from the lender under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest. <br>

There are many types of debts, some debts are caused by loans, while some are caused by unknown/unintended sources. <br>

Home loans, Personal loans, Hand loans etc lead to known or intentional debt. In this case, the borrower usually intends to pay the sum off, but can't pay it off by the due time owing to some unfortunate reason and hence is indebted. <br>

Credit card bills, Margin penalties levied by stock brokers etc lead to unintended or unknown sources of debts. In this case, the person either doesn't pay the bills in time or suffers an unfortunate loss in the share markets and hence is indebted. <br>
